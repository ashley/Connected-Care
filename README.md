# As/In/Sure
### Created at the 2017 Make Me++ Hackathon

As/In/Sure is a customized device disguised as an everyday object that detects peaks of danger and anxiety. Using Arduino, we prototyped our customized device using 3D printed eye glasses and our sensors. The device then connects to a web application, which includes an interface that shows the user's levels of anxiety and danger on bar charts. The user's support group can also set up notifications on their phone if the user reaches high levels of anxiety or danger.

#### Technology Used
We used a Electron Photon as our microcontroller along with Audrino pulse and temperature sensors. For software, we programmed using Arduino framework and D3.js and Twilio's API for our web app.
